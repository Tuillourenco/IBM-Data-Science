#In this repo, I've practiced with real-life examples of Machine learning and see how it affects my daily routines in ways I've never guessed and got the following achievements:
## 1) New skills to add to my resume, such as regression, classification, clustering, sci-kit learn and SciPy. 
## 2) New projects that I added to your portfolio, including cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, recommendation engines, and many more.
## 3) And a certificate in machine learning to prove my competency.
